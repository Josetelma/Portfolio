<h1>Portfolio</h1>
<br>
<h2>Within my portfolio, you will find some projects, from responsive and interactive to web applications. I used HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript to create attractive interfaces, focusing on usability and user experience. Each project represents an opportunity for learning and professional growth.

<h3>Exploring my portfolio is a way to learn about my work and personal style, as well as the skills I've acquired over time.</h3>

<li>HTML Structure:
HTML to create the overall structure of my portfolio. Each project, section, or visual element must be encapsulated in appropriate HTML tags. Links and navigation are also configured using HTML.</li>
<br>
<li>CSS Style:
I used CSS to style and give an attractive design to my portfolio. Define color schemes, fonts, text sizes, page layout and animations and make it responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.</li>
<br>
<li>JavaScript:
I used JavaScript to improve the interactivity of my portfolio. Implementing interactive image galleries, smooth scrolling effects, among other interactive features. Also to dynamically show information about my projects.</li>
